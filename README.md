# Machine Learning: Detecting Heart Disease using Decision Tree Classifier
This repository contains the step-by-step process of building a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict heart disease based on provided information form the dataset in the repositary. The dataset used in this project was collected from the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The actual dataset contains patient data collected from four different institutions located at four different locations: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach. the **Processed Cleveland Dataset** was used to build the decision tree classifier.
